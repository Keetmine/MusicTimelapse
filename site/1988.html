			 description='"Where Is My Mind?" is a song by the American alternative rock band Pixies. It is the seventh track on their 1988 debut album Surfer Rosa. The song was written by frontman Black Francis while he attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, inspired by his experiences while scuba diving in the Caribbean. He later said he had "this very small fish trying to chase me. I dont know whyâ€”I dont know too much about fish behavior." Although the song was never released as a single, it is one of the bands signature songs. A live version of the song recorded at 2004s Coachella was released free through BitTorrent. It has been awarded Silver Certification by the BPI for UK singles.'
